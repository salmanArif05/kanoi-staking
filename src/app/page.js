			question: "WHAT IS APESTAKE.IO?",
			answer: `ApeStake.io is the official staking protocol for ApeCoin ($APE) established by the ApeCoin DAO (ApeDAO) and was created as a way for $APE, BAYC, MAYC, and BAKC holders to earn rewards through staking. $APE can be staked by itself or in conjunction with a BAYC, MAYC, or BAKC in one of the four staking pools, with each pool offering different levels of rewards.
      The ApeStake.io protocol was proposed in AIPs 21 and 22 and subsequently approved by the community on May 4, 2022. Following approval, the Ape Foundation enlisted Horizen Labs to provide a platform for the staking protocol according to the specifications set forth in the AIPs.

      To help clarify terminology, the AIPs provided definitions for some important terms:

      Staking Pools: The total ApeCoin pools that participants can earn from.

      Staking Pool Type: The pool is specifically assigned to a digital asset class; there are four in total.

      Staking Period: Each period is 12 months.

      Staking Pool Allocations: The total amount of ApeCoin allocated to each Staking Pool Type per period.

      Total Staking Period: A total of three (3) years.

      Initial Staking Period: The first 12-month period of staking.

      Pool Distribution: The spread of the staking allocation assigned across the period.

      Incentive Distribution Curve: The schedule of ApeCoin allocated for incentives per quarter.`,
