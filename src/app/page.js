			question: "WHAT IS KANOI?",
			answer: `KANOI is the official staking protocol for KANOI established by the KANOI DAO (kANOIDAO) and was created as a way for $Kanoi, BAYC, MAYC, and BAKC holders to earn rewards through staking. $Kanoi can be staked by itself or in conjunction with a BAYC, MAYC, or BAKC in one of the four staking pools, with each pool offering different levels of rewards.
      The KanoiStake.io protocol was proposed in AIPs 21 and 22 and subsequently approved by the community on May 4, 2022. Following approval, the Kanoi Foundation enlisted Horizen Labs to provide a platform for the staking protocol according to the specifications set forth in the AIPs.

      To help clarify terminology, the AIPs provided definitions for some important terms:

      Staking Pools: The total KANOI pools that participants can earn from.

      Staking Pool Type: The pool is specifically assigned to a digital asset class; there are four in total.

      Staking Period: Each period is 12 months.

      Staking Pool Allocations: The total amount of KANOI allocated to each Staking Pool Type per period.

      Total Staking Period: A total of three (3) years.

      Initial Staking Period: The first 12-month period of staking.

      Pool Distribution: The spread of the staking allocation assigned across the period.

      Incentive Distribution Curve: The schedule of KANOI allocated for incentives per quarter.`,
